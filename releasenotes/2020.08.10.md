Now uses *one* (well, sometimes two ;) single regular expression test in bash instead of parsing the json with awk, this made the script twice as fast and also, imo, easier to maintain and extend. I also added two new `--print` options, `s` for sticky status, and `e` for fullscreen status. But the most important change is done to the `--synk` functionality, which now uses `i3-msg -t subscribe` instead of a `while true; do sleep 10 ...`, and it makes everything much more responsive while at the same time being so much more efficient and nice on system recourses. Some output is different for example "marks" will now print the whole *JSON list* (`["mark1","mark2"...]`), previous behavior was to only show the first mark unqouted. If no value is found for a requested output (`--print`) a line looking like:  
`--i3get could not find: m`  
will be printed, previous behavior was to skip the line i think this new behavior is better especially if one relies on the order of the output lines.
